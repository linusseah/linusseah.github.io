    <div class="about-content">

      <p>I'm Linus Seah — an MBA student at <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Kellogg School of Management (Northwestern University)</a> and an aspiring Solutions Architect based in San Francisco.</p>

      <p>I have a software engineering background, but these days I spend most of my time thinking about the intersection of business strategy, product thinking, and AI systems. I'm particularly interested in how organizations can adopt AI tools practically — not just as demos, but as production systems that solve real problems.</p>

      <p>I learn by building. My current focus is on understanding agentic AI systems — what they can actually do, where they break down, and how to evaluate the trade-offs between complexity and value. I write about what I learn so that others navigating the same questions can benefit from the experiments I've already run.</p>

      <h2>What I Write About</h2>

      <p>My writing series, <em>Applied AI Thinking for Operators</em>, is for people who want to understand AI through the lens of building and decision-making, not just theory. Topics include: what actually happens when you integrate an LLM into a workflow, the difference between demo AI and production AI, how non-technical professionals can evaluate AI tools intelligently, and what building with agents teaches you about system design.</p>

      <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>

      <p>I'm looking for roles in AI solutions architecture, AI engineering, or technical product management — positions where I can bridge the gap between technical AI capabilities and business value. I'm especially drawn to teams building agentic systems, LLM-powered products, or AI infrastructure.</p>

      <p>If you're working on something interesting in this space, I'd love to talk.</p>
